1) What is Devops?
Devops is a combination of development and operations.its a cultural practice where which increases the organization ability to deliver the application at high velocity. Improving software development at faster pace 
Devops is all about how frequest we release the new software feautures to customers.
üöÄ Benefits of DevOps
üîÅ Faster software delivery
ü§ù Better collaboration
üêû Fewer bugs in production
üìâ Reduced downtime
üìà Higher scalability and availability
üß™ Automated testing & deployments

2) List out most commonly used commands in Devops?
‚¶Å	ls    -  list files and directory
‚¶Å	ls -l  >> long listing files
‚¶Å	touch- create a new file
‚¶Å	vi- editor command
‚¶Å	cp - copying file/folder from src to dest
‚¶Å	rm - removing files
‚¶Å	mkdir - create new directory
‚¶Å	rmdir - removing the directory
‚¶Å	pwd - present working directory
‚¶Å	cd - change directory
‚¶Å	chmod - change the file permissions
‚¶Å	chown- change the ownership 
‚¶Å	ps -list out running processe
‚¶Å	top - checking CPU usage
‚¶Å	du - disk usage
‚¶Å	df - disk free
‚¶Å	netstat - tuln >>> to check open ports
‚¶Å	ping google.com - test the connectivity
‚¶Å	wget - download file from internet
‚¶Å	scp -  copying files from onerserver to another server while copying network goes down once it resumed it starts copying where it left.
‚¶Å	rsync- copying files from onerserver to another server while copying network goes down once it resumed it starts copying from starting

3) Difference between cut and awk command

 Cut >>>this is used to cut a file in column wise to print on the command line prompt.
aws >>>it is also used as a function like cut but in cut command the delimiter have single space, and 
some may have multiple space, to overcome with this problem we can use awk


‚úÇÔ∏è cut Command ‚Äì Use Cases & Examples
Use: Extract specific columns or characters from a line

‚úÖ Use Cases:
Get specific fields from logs or CSVs

Extract usernames, emails, IPs, etc.

When you know fixed positions or delimiter
üß† awk Command ‚Äì Use Cases & Examples
Use: A full mini programming language for text processing

‚úÖ Use Cases:
Filter rows based on conditions

Perform calculations on columns

Format text output

Extract specific fields with logic

4)  Difference between Scp and Rsync  ?

scp = Secure Copy Protocol
scp >>>it is used to copy files or directories from one to another server. If copy failed due to network 
issues when network is back coyp will start from beginnnig.
It uses SSH to copy files between local and remote systems.
Simple and secure.
Always copies the full file, even if nothing changed.

 rsync = Remote Synchronization
rsync>>>> it is used to copy file or directories within the server and also between the server. If copy fails 
due to network issues once network is back it will resume the copying where it has stopped .
Used to sync files and directories between systems.
Also uses SSH, but can work locally too.
It copies only differences, saving bandwidth and time.
Can resume interrupted transfers.

5) Difference between Softlink and Hardlink?

Softlink::
Like a shortcut in Windows.
Points to the original file‚Äôs path, not the data.
If the original file is deleted or moved, the soft link breaks.

Hardlink::
it is a shortcut of a file. If we make any changes in original file then it will reflect in 
hardlink. In case if we delete the original file then hardlink will work because it points inode of a file.

6) Listout network managing commands?

ping ipaddress or hostname >>> to check weather service packets working.
 netstat ‚Äìna | grep ‚Äú8080‚Äù >>>> this is to check weather that port is working or not. 
. ps [process] ÔÉ†it is used to list current running process of a system. 
ps -ef ÔÉ† it gives the list of system running processes. 
ps -ef|grep -i ‚Äújava‚Äù ÔÉ†it gives the output of particular process ‚Äújava‚Äù weather it is running in the system 
or not. 
ps -ef|grep ‚Äúprocess1‚Äù -e ‚Äúprocess2‚Äù ÔÉ†it is used to search weather process 1 and process 2 are running. 
Kill -9<PID> ÔÉ† it is used to kill the process ids which is running in the system. 
ps -u ‚Äúusername‚Äù ÔÉ†it will show all the process starts by user.

7) How to check CPU Utilization for processors and how to reduce the cpu usage if particular process using more cpu.

Using top command we can see the cpu usgae
To reduce the CPU usage we can set the CPU limit for processor
or we can delete the process if not being important using ps command.
